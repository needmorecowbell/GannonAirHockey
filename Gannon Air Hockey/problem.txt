We took on this challenge of creating an Air Hockey game to see if we could solve the problem of 
integrating realistic physics into a game environment.  To solve the problem, it took many 
applications of mathematics, including vectors, trigonometry, and physics equations.  We had to solve
for many different problems including incorporating friction, dealing with collisions, and speed control.
To overcome these obstacles, we experimented with many different solutions.  To solve for friction, we had 
to test many different values to lower the speed of the puck each time the game updates to institute a 
realistic friction environment.  We had to use distance formulas and institute vector collisions to properly
detect collisions and designate the correct path of motion when the puck contacts a paddle or wall.
We also had to manage the speed of the puck using decision structures so that the puck would not fly 
around the screen too fast.  Creating a lifelike physics environment inside a program was a very challenging
and difficult task, yet it was very exciting to accomplish this and overcome the difficulties.
